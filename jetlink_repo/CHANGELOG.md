Jetlink v0.8.2
==============
**Mac**
* **Updates:** The app now updates itself. From 0.8.1, replace it by hand one last time.
* **Lid Closed:** New setting to keep serving with the lid closed. Thanks Nick (@mzdnick)!

**General Updates & Fixes**
* The comma's setting is now called **Jetlink** (was Accelerator Link).
* The comma 4 says to check the cable after repeated drops.
* Removed TCP debugging from the UI.
* **Update the comma:** zoompilot's `develop` branch pins Jetlink v0.8.2.

Jetlink v0.8.1
==============
**Driving**
* The big model warms up while the small model drives, so the switch is smooth.
* A late frame reuses the last plan instead of dropping. Five in a row, or 20 in 10 s, still hand back to small model.
* A big model that falls behind rejoins in about a second (was up to 60 s).

**iPhone & iPad**
* A banner on the Status tab shows when the link is USB 2, and why.
* Logs say why the comma stopped using the big model.
* **USBC to C Cable:** work in progress, try a USBC->USBA cable with USBA->C adaptor, flipping usb cable, or high quality hub.

**Android**
* Download the APK from the release page. No build needed <3
* **Automatic:** The new default. Uses a Pixel's NPU, else the GPU.
* Google has not allowed Jetlink on the Pixel NPU yet, so Pixels use the GPU for now.

**General Updates & Fixes**
* Turning on the Accelerator Link turns ADB off. They share the USB port.
* **Update the comma:** zoompilot's `develop` branch pins Jetlink v0.8.1.

Jetlink v0.8.0
==============
**iPhone & iPad on TestFlight!**
* Install from [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/DAsYk5sP). No Xcode needed <3
* **Tested:** Driven with an iPhone in the car.
* **Direct Cable:** USB-C to USB-C should now work without a hub. Not yet tested.

**Android on more phones**
* Big models run on any phone's GPU, not just Snapdragon. The GPU is now the default.
* **NPU:** Still an option on Snapdragon.
* Not yet tested on a phone. Run the Benchmark before you drive.

**Driving**
* **Slow Model Handback:** A throttling iPhone no longer forces a disengagement. The small model takes over instead.

**General Updates & Fixes**
* **Faster Jetson Start:** Ready in 25 s (was 38.5). Run `jetlink update`.
* **Jetson Desktop:** The installer can turn it off to free memory. Existing installs: `jetlink setup`.
* **Installer:** Shorter, plainer questions.
* **Benchmark:** A run with no frames now says **Too Slow**.
* **Loading:** Shows seconds instead of a stuck 0%.
* **Cable:** Use a USB 3 USB-C cable for the Mac, iPhone and Android.
* **Update the comma:** zoompilot's `jetson-trt` branch pins Jetlink v0.8.0.

Jetlink v0.7.4
==============
**General Updates & Fixes**
* **Linux PCs:** The installer runs on Debian 12, Fedora, Arch and openSUSE as well as Ubuntu: the base packages come from apt, dnf, pacman or zypper, the NVIDIA driver is installed on Arch and on Ubuntu's and Arch's derivatives too (printed as the distribution's own steps elsewhere), and a system without systemd or with a glibc older than Ubuntu 22.04's is refused up front. Ubuntu is what users have tested; the others are untested on hardware.

Jetlink v0.7.3
==============
**General Updates & Fixes**
* **No False LOW MEMORY Alert:** With the Accelerator Link on, the comma counted about 10% more memory as used than it was, and drives at a real 80% showed **LOW MEMORY** with a takeover warning. The free-memory floor Jetlink set on the comma is gone; the dirty-memory caps that keep the link smooth stay. Driven with no regression.
* **Update the comma:** zoompilot's `develop`, `danger-unstable` and `jetson-trt` branches pin Jetlink v0.7.3. All of this runs on the comma; the server needs no update.

Jetlink v0.7.2
==============
**General Updates & Fixes**
* **Cinque Terre V3 in sunnylink:** sunnylink's model selector now lists Cinque Terre V3 (zoompilot reads sunnypilot's newer big-model list).
* **Model List:** A spotty connection no longer drops a newer model from the list. It could reset your pick and quietly switch the default to Cinque Terre V2.
* **Update the comma:** zoompilot's `jetson-trt` branch pins Jetlink v0.7.2. All of this runs on the comma; the server needs no update.

Jetlink v0.7.1
==============
**Driving**
* **Stays Engaged:** If the big model drops or falls behind while engaged, the comma shows **TAKE CONTROL** for 5 seconds and keeps driving on the small model (was a soft disable). Lateral-only (MADS) driving gets the same warning.
* **No Lag Alert After a Pull:** The small model takes over within a frame, the first pull of a drive included (was over a second), with no "Driving Model Lagging" afterwards. A server that stops answering is caught in 0.2 s (was 0.5).
* **Switch Without Stopping:** Connected mid-drive? Turn cruise fully off and engage again: the next engagement uses the big model. The comma says **Big Model Ready: Re-engage to switch** once, not at every stop, and **Big Model Active** when you can engage on it.
* **Steering:** No kick when the big model hands back mid-drive.
* **Replug:** A Jetson plugged back in reconnects at once (could wait up to a minute).

**General Updates & Fixes**
* **Accelerator Link:** Switching out of iOS no longer needs a power cycle: change it with the car off.
* **Mac:** The Models inspector holds the model's actions; the toolbar button only opens it.
* **Update the comma:** zoompilot's `jetson-trt` branch pins Jetlink v0.7.1. All of this runs on the comma; the server needs no update.

Jetlink v0.7.0
==============
**Android support!**
* Run big models on a Snapdragon phone's NPU over USB (experimental, build from source) <3
* Turn on: Settings > Models > Accelerator Link > USB.

**One Swift engine everywhere**
* Jetsons, Linux PCs, the Mac, iPhone/iPad and Android all run the same Swift server.
* On a Jetson it gives v0.6.0's output bit for bit, with half the CPU.
* **No Docker:** Jetsons and PCs run it natively. `jetlink update` moves your install over, keeping settings, models and engines.
* **Update the comma and Jetlink together:** New link protocol; zoompilot's `jetson-trt` branch pins Jetlink v0.7.0. A comma on an older build stays on the small model.

**General Updates & Fixes**
* **Faster Link:** Big-model frames 3 to 5 ms quicker on the bench Jetson: 2.2 ms of USB transport (was 8.5). Replies are 8 KB (was 74 KB): the hidden state stays on the server. USB 3 power saving is off only while the comma is sending.
* **Parked:** The Jetson sleeps between its half-hourly wake checks: awake about 1% of a park (was 6%).
* **Reliability:** The comma restarts Jetlink if it stops, alerts when it cannot, and no longer stalls at shutdown. A new model the Jetson has never seen uploads right away. "Power off with the comma" reaches the Jetson every time.
* **Forks:** openpilot forks plug Jetlink in through one adapter module (developers: `jetlink/openpilot`).
* **Status Page:** Watch the server from your phone at `http://<name>.local:5600`.
* **Stay Awake:** `jetlink caffeinate` keeps a Jetson awake while you work on it.
* **iPhone:** Neural Engine + GPU is the default (14 ms a frame on an iPhone 18 Pro).
* **Linux PCs:** The installer puts NVIDIA's TensorRT 11.3 in `/opt/jetlink`; no system TensorRT.
* **Tested:** JetPack 7.2.1 and the Mac, in the car. JetPack 6.2, Linux PCs and WSL2 are untested.

**Removed**
* Python server, Docker images and `scripts/run-mac.sh` (use `jetlink-server`).

Jetlink v0.6.0
==============
**Mac**
* **Swift only:** No bundled Python; 14 MB download (was 120 MB).
* **Settings:** Server and Log level removed.
* The Python server still runs from a checkout: `scripts/run-mac.sh`.

Jetlink v0.5.0
==============
**iPhone & iPad support!**
* Run big models on an iPhone or iPad over one USB cable (experimental, build with Xcode) <3
* Turn on: Settings > Models > Accelerator Link > iOS.
* Thank you Casey (@ScriptDrifter) for the original iPhone port!

**One Swift engine**
* The Mac and iPhone/iPad apps now share one Swift server, matched to the Python server's output.

**General Updates & Fixes**
* **Accelerator Link:** Now Off, USB or iOS. Set it again after updating.
* **Default Model:** Cinque Terre V3.
* **Model Switching:** New models download and build in one step.
* **Reliability:** Recovers in seconds if the Jetson server restarts mid-drive.
* **Jetson Power Off:** Fixed the comma not shutting the Jetson down.
* **Installer:** Installs the latest release; `jetlink update` moves to the newest.
* **Mac:** Swift server option with no Python, and a Benchmark page.

**Removed**
* tinygrad backend and Jetson over Ethernet.

Jetlink v0.4.3
==============
**Mac**
* **Fixed:** "No bundled Python runtime" when opening from Finder or the Dock on macOS 15.

Jetlink v0.4.2
==============
**Mac**
* **Signed & Notarized:** Opens without the Gatekeeper workaround.

Jetlink v0.4.0
==============
**One-command install!**
* Sets up your Jetson or Linux PC with one command.
* `jetlink update` updates, and rolls back if it fails.

**General Updates & Fixes**
* **JetPack:** 6.2 and 7.2 (7.2 is ~12% faster).
* **Linux PCs:** NVIDIA driver 580+.
* **Models:** Cinque Terre V3, and new big models show up without a Jetlink update.
* **Jetson Sleep:** Fixed on stock JetPack.

**Mac**
* **Apple Silicon:** M1 Pro and up, with the model split across the Neural Engine and GPU.
* **Models:** Preload with one click. Models from v0.3.0a1 prepare again once.
* **Latency:** New visualizations.
* **Branding:** New Jetlink look and icon.
