Who may do endpoint IO on the gadget, while one process owns it throughout.

The owner (owner.py) holds ep0 for as long as the link is on, and nothing else
ever does: when two processes took turns at it, every change of owner was an
unplug, a fresh libusb open and a fresh server session as the Jetson saw it.

What still has to change hands is the right to read the endpoint files.
FunctionFS keeps a queued read queued until something completes it, so a second
reader would sit behind the first and take its reply. This is the handshake for
that: modeld borrows for the length of a drive, the owner stays off the
endpoints while it does, and the connection is the lease, so a modeld that is
killed returns it by dying. There is no "give it back" message: the socket
closing is the only signal, because it is the only one a killed process sends.

An iPhone cannot take the endpoint files: it is on the gadget's network
interface and dials the comma at CABLE_ADDR. Whoever holds the loan listens
for that dial: the owner while nobody does (CableListener), so a parked phone
shows connected and a dial is news that starts a provisioning run, and the
borrower while it holds the loan (Loan.accept), for the drive or the run. The
handshake is the handover: the owner closes its listener and the dial it
holds before it says yes, and listens again once the loan ends. No socket
changes hands, and nothing shares one.
