A ModelState that starts as the small model and upgrades to the Jetson.

modeld's large-model load is a one-shot with BIG_MODEL_TIMEOUT and a silent,
one-way fallback. That suits a chestnut, powered from the comma. A Jetson is
on the ignition rail: cranking browns it out, so its boot starts about when
the comma goes onroad and takes 45 to 100 s, long after modeld gave up.

So modeld is handed the small model it already loaded, and the Jetson is
swapped in underneath once the link, the engine and the warp are all there.
modeld re-reads `model` every frame, and `modelV2.big` keeps its meaning.

From the join on, every frame goes to the Jetson whether or not it drives:
the small model drives on, and the large model's history and hidden state are
current and warm when the swap comes, so its first driving frame costs what
every frame costs. The swap itself changes which model's output is published
and nothing else. While it drives, a reply that is not back in time is not
waited for: the previous frame's output is published again (a held frame,
model_state.HOLD_FRAME) and the camera frame is not dropped. Too many holds
hand the drive back to the small model, as a lost link does.

Two rules the swap keeps:

- tinygrad work happens on modeld's thread. The joining thread does link IO
  only; building the JetlinkModelState unpickles a TinyJit, and doing that
  next to the small model running frames on the same device is not safe.
- never swap while the plan is steering. The two models disagree by ~195 m of
  planned path, and the swap costs a frame or two. Require fresh, fully
  disengaged controls; standstill alone is not enough, longitudinal control
  may still hold the brake.
